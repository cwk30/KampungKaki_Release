KampungKaki is created using React Native as the front end, and Flask as the back end, and hosted on AWS EC2.


KampungKaki sports 3 main features: the block chat, the tompang me pls! feature, as well as the bulk order feature.


### Block Chat


The block chat feature allows users of the same block to chat with one another. A chat room is created for each new user of a particular block, and subsequent users will be added to that chat group.


### Tompang Pls


#### Request

Request for help from your neighbors! File a request for help dabaoing from your favourite hawker, or even to borrow items.


#### Offer

Coming back from a hawker? Post a offer to help to earn points!


#### Pending Requests/Offers

Accept Offers and Requests for help! Earn points by accepting such offers.


### Bulk Buy

#### Hawker

Vote to decide what you are gonna have for your next meal! A default hawker that we decide to shine the spotlight on to support will be nominated by default, but feel free to nominate your choices! The winning vote will be placed in the order form 4 hrs before delivery time, for bulk ordering.

#### Wet Market

The nearest wet market offerings will available for your block to bulk buy from. No more going down to markets (where large crowds are!), and enjoy bulk discounts with your block!
